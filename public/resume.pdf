I need you to create a personal website for me as part of my LSU Distinguished Communicator portfolio. The site should present me both personally and professionally, while showcasing the communication competencies required by the program (written, spoken, visual, and technological communication). It must feel modern, polished, and cutting-edge—closer to a founder/tech CEO site than a typical student portfolio.

Core requirements

Homepage (Landing)

Hero section with my name, headshot (placeholder), and a succinct tagline that captures my identity as both a CEO/CTO of a safety & compliance AI startup (Smartective) and a dual degree student in Biological Engineering + Computer Science at LSU.

Visual emphasis on innovation, leadership, and communication.

Subtle animation or interaction (e.g., text that cycles between “Engineer. Communicator. Founder.”).

About Me

Blend personal background (age, LSU student, dual degree path, Louisiana roots, outside interests like biomechanics, startups, watch design) with professional identity (CEO of Smartective, technical architect, founder).

Emphasize communication and leadership qualities.

Communication Competencies (Required by Distinguished Communicator)

Written Communication: Showcase writing samples (business plan excerpts, equity models, technical guides). Include short summaries with downloadable/viewable pieces.

Spoken Communication: Embed or link to recordings/presentations (can use placeholder video/audio). Summarize speaking engagements or leadership communication experiences.

Visual Communication: Portfolio of slide decks, diagrams, UI/UX prototypes, data visualizations, or marketing assets I’ve created.

Technological Communication: Demonstrate software projects (e.g., Smartective’s AI compliance platform, voice-to-form system, IoT safety monitoring). Include short project cards with images, descriptions, and what role I played.

Professional Experience

Timeline or portfolio grid of my roles (Founder/CEO, CTO, research projects, internships).

Highlight achievements with emphasis on communication impact (e.g., pitching, technical documentation, cross-disciplinary leadership).

Projects

Dedicated section for select standout projects (startup, machine learning experiments, biomedical device design).

Each project should have a short case-study style write-up: context, problem, my role, communication challenge, and outcome.

Contact

Clean, simple form with email and links to LinkedIn, GitHub, and possibly Calendly.

Branded with my professional email (raedan@smartective.com
).

Style and Feel

Aesthetic: minimalist, modern, tech-forward (similar to founder/engineer personal sites).

Typography: bold sans-serif with clean hierarchy.

Colors: sharp contrast (black/white base with LSU-inspired accent tones like gold or purple, used sparingly).

Layout: modular, grid-based, with cards and hover effects.

Animations: subtle, professional—no gimmicks.

Accessibility: fully responsive, optimized for desktop and mobile.

Cutting-edge but professional: think tech startup meets academic excellence.

Tone and Voice

Confident but approachable.

Blends entrepreneurial drive with academic credibility.

Showcases leadership, innovation, and strong communication across disciplines.
